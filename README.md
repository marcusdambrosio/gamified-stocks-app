# gamified_stocks_app
A gamified investment app that allows you to purchase "mystery stocks" with varying values.

The app.exe file will open a GUI that prompts you to select how many stocks you'd like to purchase for $200 each and then show you which randomly generated stocks you are given and their values. I'm not sure where the probability generation script is but I'm pretty sure I rigged it so that the buyer will lose money 51% of the time so the hypothetical company offering this gamified investing platform would generate 1% of all investments/purchases as revenue.

Future additions: 
-Load updated stock values and adjust probabilities accordingly every time the app is initialized
-Add some sort of "portfolio" feature that tracks someones rolls over time
